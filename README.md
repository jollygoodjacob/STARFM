## STARFM

The STARFM (Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model) algorithm is widely used to generate high-resolution, high-frequency remote sensing data by fusing low-resolution, high-temporal and high-resolution, low-temporal imagery to produce a synthetic image.

Letâ€™s break down how STARFM works, with specific reference to the Python implementation by Mileva (2018), available here:

### Intuition - STARFM
STARFM predicts what a fine-resolution image would look like on a date where only coarse-resolution data is available by using:

-  One fine-resolution image at a base date (e.g., UAV or Planet)

-  Two coarse-resolution images at base and target dates (e.g., MODIS or Sentinel)

It assumes that spectral change in coarse resolution over time also applies locally at finer scale.

### Processing Steps
1. Input data:

- F_t1: fine-resolution image at time t1 

- C_t1: coarse-resolution image at time t1 
  
- C_t2: coarse-resolution image at time t2 (prediction date)

2. Calculate change in coarse resolution
3. Loop over fine-resolution pixels: For each fine-resolution pixel, the algorithm:

- Finds a window of nearby pixels in the fine-resolution image

- Checks spectral similarity between fine and coarse images at t1

- Computes weights based on:

  - Spatial distance

  - Spectral similarity (Euclidean difference)

  - Temporal change magnitude

4. Prediction:
- Apply weighted average of reflectance changes

- Add that change to the fine-resolution pixel at t1:
6. Output:
- A synthetic high-resolution image at time t2: F_t2
